INSTRUCTIONS AND COMMENTS
=========================

Getting started
---------------
If the daunting task of reading the source code has been bestowed upon you, 
I'd recommend limiting yourself to lattice.[h,cpp] and main.cpp. Do not venture
in to my own personal playground that is auxiliary.cpp. Also save.[h,cpp] is 
redundant for understanding the physics that is simulated, and understanding 
the definitions in classes.[h,cpp] is crucial.

Running on many computers
-------------------------
 use ssh:
      $ ssh -n 'cd /to/path; nice -19 ./prog < input.dat'
 Or:  $ ssh -X nice -19 ./prog output.dat < input.dat'
Use che or che2 to find available computers. If compiled with threads, there 
might be an issue, with loading the *.so (shared object) files libboost_thread.so


Files
-----
Makefile        Needed to compile the project. Contains description to compile
                the binary *.o files, and on which files they depend upon.

main.cpp        main function. Most of the code is for finding input parameters, 
                and setting the jumprate and sampling time vector.

main_thread.cpp Same as main.cpp, but uses threads, and depends on libboost_thread
                and does not use nr/nr3.h, but rather a modified nr/ran_mod.h, or
                else boost will not compile. The random number sequence is the same.

nr/             Folder where all the needed header files taken from Numerical
                Recipes (W.Press). This can be replaced with a symbolic link
                to the actual folder where all NR-files are located. 

save.[h,cpp]    Save routine. During simulation it stores the MSD for each 
                individual "ensemble", and then computes standard deviation,
                correlation, etc, and prints results to a file.

lattice.[h,cpp] This is where the physics happens.

classes.[h,cpp] Defines the Jump class, which depends on the Direction class.
                The Particle class is not yet (v.8) used.

auxiliary.[h,cpp]   Personal playground with "nifty by unnecessary shit". 
                    The most important content is the printError-function,
                    Disregard the rest.



Compiling and the Makefile
--------------------------
Just running the command "make" in the source directory defaults to running the Makefile that's placed therein. Don not use optimization flags ( -O2 or -O3) if you intend to debug the code (compile with -g flag). The Makefile can take a number of different commands by running the following from the command line:

make           Compile the binary "prog" from main.cpp
make thread    Compile using main_thread.cpp, and link against lboost_thread.
make super     Compile the binary "super" from superProg.cpp which is the 
               "super interaction"-code, currently in testing stage.
make tar       Create prog.tar.gz with all needed source files.
make zip       Create prog.zip with all needed source files.
make clean     Remove all binary object files (*.o) 
make tags      Create a Tags-file for Emacs. Use M-. in emacs to navigate the files.
make lines     Returns the total number of lines of code. ( :D ) 
make -f Makefile_thread  use main_thread.cpp instead. Requires libboost_thread v. < 1.39 
               to be installed.

The Makefile will recompile any files that have been changed and all files that depend on it, thus speeding up the compilation, and always making sure the binary is correctly linked.



Running
-------
For help on command flags and arguments just run the program with the -h flag. For convenience they are given below:
-h         Displays a help.
-m         Use the (much) less memory consuming algorithm. Advisable if 
           (Number of values to store) x (number of ensembles) / 2^30 ~ RAM (in Gb) 
-l         Use logarithmic spacing of the data points (time sampling points)
-i M       the -i option activates the interaction-algorithm, with "M"
           being the interaction strength. Note that M >= 0. If M = 0
           the simulation gives the same result as without, but it will run slower.
-w target  changes the default output file name: "out.dat" to "target",
           which can include a path and name up to 99 characters long.
-q         Run in "quiet mode", i.e. less printout to screen.
-B N       Generate N different output-files with the same input parameters, 
           by using bootstrap; after the simulation it generates N synthetic output-files.
-b N       Generate N different output-files with the same input parameters, 
           by using Brute force, i.e. Just rerun the simulation N times.
-j         Turn on the jackknife algorithm to print out a corrected error to the screen
           and file appended with "_jackknife"

Dimension
---------
The program accurately accounts for all dimensions larger than 1. This means that a lattice with size 100x100x0 or 100x100x1 is considered two dimensional lattice, and only moves in X and Y are made. All particles still have a Z-coordinate, but no move will be made in this direction as long as Z<2, or else we would "leak" some probability/speed of the particles. 


Jump-rates
----------
The code has been written so if anyone is so inclined they can have different jump rates in different directions, to allow simulations during some biased/potential influence on the particles. 

setting jump rates in three dimensions if only 2D lattice will ... XXX-TODO-XXX!



Output-files
------------
The primary output-file, (default name is out.dat) has the following form:
    <time>  <dr^2>  <dr^2_error>    <4th column>,
where the "4th column" is either the Pearson coefficient, which 
determines the correlation between the current value and the next; or 
it is "z" (H*z=t) needed to compute the MSD (<dr^2>) and error, and does not
require us to save the entire H-matrix. This is set from the Save::computeCorrelation()-function, which can also print the entire H-matrix
to a separate file ("name"_matrix), where "name" is the name of the primary 
out-file (default: out.dat), but this is primarily for testing purpose.


Coding Conventions
------------------
The code follows the following rules:
(see http://geosoft.no/development/cppstyle.html)
 ______________________________________________________
|DESCRIPTION              | EXAMPLE                    |
|=========================|============================| 
|All variables:           | camelCase, myVariable      | 
|-------------------------|----------------------------| 
|Constants:               | MY_CONSTANT                | 
|-------------------------|----------------------------| 
|Private class variables: | camelCase_                 | 
|-------------------------|----------------------------| 
|Types:                   | CamelCase, MyType, Particle| 
|(always a noun)          | Direction, etc.            | 
|-------------------------|----------------------------| 
|Functions & methods:     | getVariable(), computeD(), |
|(always a verb)          | setVariable()              | 
'______________________________________________________'

-"Generic variables should have the same name as their type"

-operators are preceded and followed by space, " == ", " + " etc.

-Note: underscore "_" can be used in the standard LaTeX-sense: pos_0 etc.  

use "int&" rather than "int &"


Additional speed
----------------
When running huge simulations one could try commenting some of the testing if-statements that are there to find bugs. The most used functions are:
  Lattice::moveAndBoundaryCheck
  Lattice::vacancyCheck
  Lattice::convertMuToParticle
Also investigate convertMuToParticle for changing to binary search method. (TODO).





CHANGE LOG
==========

version 8 (15/2 2011)
----------------------------
-Renamed "prog.cpp" to more appropriate "main.cpp".
-Made a threading version of main.cpp, called main_thread.cpp. It uses the
 thread-package in the boost library. Increase in speed more than two-fold.
-Re-made the Makefile, now it is glorious.
-Changed the search-function (slightly) in Lattice::convertMuToParticle()
-Moved all the save-routines to their own class, save.[h,cpp],
 and compensated for it in main.cpp and superProg.cpp
-Continued the renaming of variables according to mentioned 
 convention above. (dx -> dx_, etc.)
-Removed all if-statements in main.cpp that allowed for using
 Lattice::moveOld()-function. (I never use it)
-Converted all "char*, char name[]" types to std::strings.
-Output-files now stores which waiting time distribution was used.
-Made the binning function in save.cpp work.
-Added a bootstrapping function in the save-class, (with b flag) 
-Added a Jackknife function in the save-class, and a command flag "-j".
-Added a "hybrid" bootknife function in save::computeBootstrap. It is
 hard coded and turned on/off by boolean at head of save.cpp.
-Put an additional loop outside the ensemble loop, so now I can
 run many simulations in a row (with the same parameters), to generate
 numerous output-files, which I need to check the correlation between 
 sampling points. Also made two new command flags, b (use bootstrap), and
 B (use Brute force), both requires one to specify the number of re-runs.
-Introduced two global variables in save.cpp, for easy hard coding
 access to turn on/off of correlation function, and binning function.

version 7 (Nov 2010)
---------
-Renamed and split up my main (singleton) class to "Lattice"
(lattice.[h,cpp])
-Made my TESTinteraction.cpp (generally called "super interaction")
into a class SuperInteraction, that inherits all the public and protected
methods/variables of the Lattice class. This makes it use the same source
code as the lattice class, plus some specific functions. I'm keeping the
old TESTinteraction.cpp for documentation, since it is completely self-
contained, (ie. everything in one source file, except ran.h & nr3.h).
-Introduced the H-matrix and computeCorrelation-function, to compute
the correlation between sampling points, and use an H-matrix that
automagically removes/compensates for correlation. (Work on this
 continues in the next version, as it is not 100% complete)
-Use of svd.h evaluates the error in H-matrix due to floating point.
-made setSamplingTime take an additional optional argument for
exponential waiting time.
-Moved all the numerical recipes codes to their own folder.
-The three main Seeds will now be set through define-macros.

version 6 
---------
NOTE: from this version forward the output is not comparable to 
previous simulations, by use of the "diff"-command, since I now have
a new algorithm to set the sampling times! The simulation result is 
still the same, physically, but not truly identical.

-Changed the calculation of average diffusion constant to omit the
tagged particle.
-Activated the LowMem command flag ('-m')
-Resolved the spaghetti that was my sampling time code. In doing so,
removed get_[dx,dy,dz,dr], set_dt, etc, and other garbage
-Renamed the matrices dx,dy,dz,dr to store_dx, store_dy. etc
-New single row vector called dx,dy,dz,dr, to store the displacement
for a single "ensemble". These are then stored in store_dx, store_dy, etc.
-Made a template of the getNonCommentInput function, and removed the 
two functions specific for int/double return value. (in auxiliary.cpp) 
-Created the computeWaitingTime()-method, and encapsulated the move()
function in a while(time is still running) condition.
-Changed the logarithmic spacing between the data points, to be more 
like the algorithm in the Gillespie-source code. 
-Calculate the pearsonCoefficient, and print it to the output as a 
fourth column. This is work in progress. Not complete. This also 
depends on a LU-decomposition and adds the dependency to ludcmp.h 


version 5:
---------
Note: this is the last version that gives output-files that are comparable 
with all previous simulations used in my master thesis, and elsewhere.  

-Removed the six jump-rate vectors, and the three overloaded setJumpRate-
functions. Implemented a new Jump class, with members .x.r, .x.l, .y.r, etc.

-I do have an auxiliary.h file
 

version 4:
---------
????


-removed the Xpos, Ypos, Zpos vectors and made the class Particle, 
to store the position of the particles:
(Particle pos[i].x pos[i].y was Xpos[i], Ypos[i] etc.) 



version 3
---------
Just stating what it looks like:
-all vectors normal int/double, ie. 3 for pos. + 6 for jumprate 
-Uses auxiliary.cpp (no h-file)
-has quiet-flag
-has LowMem
-interaction + (normal) hard-core interaction merged

version 2.5
-----------
-merged the two separate codes prog.cpp + progInteraction.cpp
into one single file. progInteraction.cpp was the one I previously 
used for particles with an attractive potential. (see Master thesis.)
-I ran many test to see that nothing got messed up when I merged 
them, but it was straight forward. only one if-statement, basically, 
to check if we should use the interaction algorithm.   


version 2
---------
-Last version with prog.cpp and progInteraction.cpp separate. 


-Fixed serious bug in original Gillespie code for finding the right mu. 
It got stuck in an infinite loop for large simulations.

-all versions see a continuous revision of comments and naming of 
variables, as I have been consistently inconsistent in the naming 
convention. (See README.txt for my new rules on how to do this)
